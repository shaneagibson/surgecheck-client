# surgecheck-client

A simple Cordova client application for providing time-based and geolocation-based trending for Uber's surge multiplier

This application (alongside it's Java-based service) was developed from concept to a working application in 9 days of pool-side development while attending an Agile conference in Bangalore in April 2015.

Unfortunately, the application was in violation of Uber's Terms & Conditions (which prohibit aggregating their data), and had to be removed from the Play and App Stores.

But it was a fun exercise in extremely-rapid delivery of a (temporarily) working product! :)
